description: Conversion tool for OCaml parsetrees between major versions
---

OCaml Migrate Parsetree (omp) is a library handling the evolution of the [Parsetree](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/trunk/parsing/parsetree.mli) data types as the OCaml compiler evolves. This is crucial as ppx-es rely on knowing what the shape of parsetree is that they operate on.
