description: A tool for writing extensible parsers
---

Camlp4 is a software system for writing extensible programming language parsers. It was the original way to extend the OCaml language to include things that ppx now covers. It is no longer maintained and users are highly recommended to look at using [ppx](/workflows/meta-programming-with-ppx/) to achieve their goals.
