A beginner doesn't want to get caught up in tooling. A beginner wants to write OCaml code, learn the syntax and explore the module system, types and pattern-matching. Take for example JavaScript or Python. For JS there are tools like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or the console on modern browsers to start interacting with the language.
