## Overview

---

This is a very powerful, yet difficult to get started with library for doing logging in OCaml. The key idea is that logging should:

1. Have a severity of reporting level (`Debugger`, `Error` ...)
2. A source - it should be easy to find where something is being printed from. 
3. Independent - programmers should be able to turn logs on and off to help track down bugs.
