    <p>Welcome to Explore OCaml, a centralise source for getting things done in the OCaml programming language. Check the <a href="/pages/about">about</a> page for more information on Explore OCaml and the <a href="/pages/opam">opam page</a> if you are unfamiliar with the OCaml Package Manager as it will come up a lot. Otherwise, choose the user that best matches you and explore the workflows.</p>

        <h1 class="ruled"><a href="/users/beginner">Beginners</a></h1>
        <p>Are you just starting out and want to learn the OCaml language? There are several resources to get you going! The beginner workflows will get you familiar with where you can find answers to common questions, find interactive playgrounds, and hook into possibly familiar learning mechanisms such as Jupyter notebooks.</p>

         <h1 class="ruled"><a href="/users/application-developers">Application Developers</a></h1>
        <p> If you have found an OCaml application that you want to work on and extend, then read on about the Application Developer workflows. This will get you started with a build environment and all the dependencies you need to build the application within a modern IDE.</p>

        <h1 class="ruled"><a href="/users/distribution-manager">Distribution Managers</a></h1>
        <p>Maintaining OCaml on a particular operating system means juggling the various quirks of OCaml applications and libraries with hundreds of other programming languages and build systems. The Distribution Manager workflows collect tools that operate over the opam repository metadata and provide mechanisms to programmatically translate them to your own distribution.</p>

        <h1 class="ruled"><a href="/users/teacher">Teachers</a></h1>
        <p>Teaching OCaml to a class necessitates supporting the installation of the tools on a variety of platforms, and hooking into grading systems. Not to mention a good setup for yourself. The teaching workflows will cover that, and also link to projects that exist to support your efforts.</p>

      <section class="span4 condensed">
        <h1 class="ruled"><a href="/users/library-author">Library Authors</a></h1>
        <p>Library authors want to share code as reusable chunks. As a Library Author, you will learn how to partition your source code into multiple libraries, to write unit tests and documentation, to apply auto-formatting, and eventually publish them publicly to the central opam repository.</p>

        <h1 class="ruled"><a href="/users/end-user">End Users</a></h1>
        <p> To install an OCaml application as fast as possible on your platform, read on about the end user workflows can enable just that. Beyond the standard opam client, there are also several domain-specific ones that may be more useful to you, such as the opam2nix binary distributor or the esy client that supports npm-like description files.</p>
